## LONELINESS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS: LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS IN 15 COUNTRIES- Supplemental material ##

#This file is a supplement to the paper "Loneliness and cognitive function in older adults: longitudinal analysis in 15 countries" by Cach√≥n-Alonso et al. (2023). It contains the code used to conduct the main analysis included in the paper in following order:
#1. Data preparation and sample selection
#2. Modelling steps: unconstrained/grand means constrained/constrained model
#3. Multiple group RI-CLPM
#4. RI-CLPM adjusted for confounders
#Our statistical analysis were conducted with semTools (Jorgensen et al., 2022) and lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) using R (version 4.1.2) and following the coding steps proposed by Mulder and Hamaker (2021)  https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/lavaan.html

#Data comes from waves 5 to 7/8 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). In our study, we included two measures of loneliness, four measures of cognitive function, and data on seven confounders. The final dataset included 55,662 adults (3 repeated measures). 
#Here, we show as an example the code for the models exploring the associations between verbal fluency and the three-item measure of loneliness. All other models followed the same steps.
